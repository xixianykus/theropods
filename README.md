This is trying out creating a  *fake* REST api from the following article:

https://dev.to/myogeshchavan97/how-to-easily-create-and-host-your-own-rest-api-without-writing-a-single-line-of-code-2np4

The web page is at:
https://my-json-server.typicode.com/xixianykus/theropods

The file can be accessed: 
https://my-json-server.typicode.com/xixianykus/theropods/db

(The file has to be called db.json to work with typicode it seems)

## Testing
Can check locally and WWW using https://hoppscotch.io/ (online app instead of Postman)

- Post the url into the address bar. 
  - https://my-json-server.typicode.com/xixianykus/theropods/db
  - localhost:3000/db
- Make sure it's set to GET.
- press the SEND button


## Limitations

Described as a *fake* REST api so not sure how limited it is compared with a real one? 
Strict limits on the service: max of 5 apis. JSON files are 10kb max.

## More apis

There's a ton of free apis here:
